## Tumour regression is induced by transient macrophage activation 

Contrary to what was expected, we did not find any major differences between the MCT populations (macrophages that were stimulated to induce tumour regression) and the control (early-stage/not-treated) groups. We hypothesized that these could be due to the timming of the capture of macrophages for sequencing, which was performed 72 hours after treatment. Therefore, we performed a time course analysis of transcription in ex vivo macrophages from mouse tumours after stimulation for selected targets measured by RT-qPCR. We found that these macrophages function through peaks of gene expression after activation, with the highest expression ocurring between 6 and 24 hours. At 72 hours, expression of these targets returns to baseline levels comparable to control (not-treated) macrophages. Therefore, we are currently sequencing more samples of tumour-infitrating myeloid cells, including macrophages at 12h after stimulation. With this experiment we expect to capture the full diversity of activated macrophages that are capable of killing tumour cells.
